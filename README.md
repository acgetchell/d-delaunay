D-dimensional Delaunay triangulations in [Rust], inspired by [CGAL].

## Introduction

This library implements d-dimensional Delaunay triangulations in [Rust]. It is
inspired by [CGAL], which is a [C++] library for computational geometry;
and [Spade], a [Rust] library implementing 2D [Delaunay triangulations],
[Constrained Delaunay triangulations], and [Voronoi diagrams]. The eventual
goal of this library is to provide a lightweight alternative to [CGAL] for
the [Rust] ecosystem.

## Features

- [x]  d-dimensional [Delaunay triangulations]
- [x]  Tested for 3-, 4-, and 5-dimensional triangulations
- [x]  Arbitrary data types associated with vertices and cells
- [x]  Serialization/Deserialization of all data structures to/from [JSON]

At some point I may merge into another library, such as [Spade] or [delaunay],
but for now I am developing this to use in my [research] without trying to
figure out how to mesh with other libraries and coding conventions, and with
the minimum number of [traits] to do generic computational geometry.

## Benchmarks

The library includes comprehensive performance benchmarks for circumsphere containment algorithms. Key findings:

- **insphere_lifted**: Fastest method (~50% better than standard)
- **insphere**: Best balance of performance and numerical stability
- **insphere_distance**: Slowest but most transparent for educational use

Run benchmarks with:

```bash
cargo bench --bench circumsphere_containment
```

See [benches/README.md](benches/README.md) for detailed performance results and analysis.

The library's geometric predicates and algorithms are based on established computational geometry literature:
