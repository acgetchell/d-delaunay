D-dimensional Delaunay triangulations in [Rust], inspired by [CGAL].

## Introduction

This library implements d-dimensional Delaunay triangulations in [Rust]. It is
inspired by [CGAL], which is a [C++] library for computational geometry;
and [Spade], a [Rust] library implementing 2D [Delaunay triangulations],
[Constrained Delaunay triangulations], and [Voronoi diagrams]. The eventual
goal of this library is to provide a lightweight alternative to [CGAL] for
the [Rust] ecosystem.

## Features

- [x]  Arbitrary data types associated with vertices and cells
- [x]  d-dimensional [Delaunay triangulations]
- [x]  Serialization/Deserialization of all data structures to/from [JSON]
- [x]  Tested for 3-, 4-, and 5-dimensional triangulations

At some point I may merge into another library, such as [Spade] or [delaunay],
but for now I am developing this to use in my [research] without trying to
figure out how to mesh with other libraries and coding conventions, and with
the minimum number of [traits] to do generic computational geometry.

## Development Tools

The repository includes utility scripts for development, testing, and performance analysis:

### Benchmarking and Performance

- **Automated benchmark execution**: Run triangulation benchmarks across multiple dimensions with GitHub Actions
- **Baseline generation**: Create performance baselines for regression detection
- **Performance regression testing**: Compare benchmark results against baseline metrics

See [benches/README.md](benches/README.md) for detailed performance results, baseline metrics, and analysis.

### Testing and Validation

- **Example execution**: Run all example programs to verify functionality
- **Comprehensive testing**: Automated discovery and execution of test suites

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for detailed documentation on available development scripts and their usage.
